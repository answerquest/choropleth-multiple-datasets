## Notes

* The reason why the folder holding the CSVs is called "googlecsv" is because when the data collection was in-progress, the CSV data was being imported live from google spreadsheets that were being filled in by ward offices via google forms. This allowed us to see the data as it came. The live connection was not always working, though, and once the data collection exercise was over, we archived the spreadhsheets to the data/googlecsv/ folder.
