## choropleth-multiple-datasets

A choropleth map that can cycle through multiple sets of values pulled in from different CSVs. Using leaflet, papa parse, jquery, bootstrap. Works in client-side Javascript.

### Notes

* The reason why the folder holding the CSVs is called "googlecsv" is because when the data collection was in-progress, the CSV data was being imported live from google spreadsheets that were being filled in by ward offices via google forms. This allowed us to see the data as it came. The live connection was not always working, though, and once the data collection exercise was over, we archived the spreadhsheets to the data/googlecsv/ folder.

* [Story Generator](https://cbgaindia.github.io/story-generator/) created by Open Budgets India / CBGA India : Goes some levels beyond this one; and I can't quite understand the inner workings yet but it's interesting, especially the multiple years and non-map graph comparison where you can pick any two or more places and compare them closely.
